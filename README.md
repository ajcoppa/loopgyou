# Overview

This is a Grey You softcore script, using the [grimoire](https://github.com/Kasekopf/grimoire) framework.

This is a fork of https://github.com/Kasekopf/loop-casual/tree/gyou with some
changes by Irrat.

## Warning: After the nerf on 1/30, this script will no longer work for most people. Use at your own risk!

### Strategy

The script is designed to be run as part of a loop. In particular, it expects that something like [garbo](https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/garbage-collector) will use the rest of the turns. This means that profitable daily resources (e.g. copiers) are avoided, but other resources (free runaways, kills, some wanderers) are used to save turns where possible.

Most people run this script through [goorbo](https://github.com/frazazel/goorbo).

### Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```
git checkout https://github.com/libraryaddict/loopgyou release
```

### Usage

1. In aftercore, run `loopgyou sim` to verify that the script is installed, and to confirm that you meet the requirements (see below for more details).
2. Ascend into a Grey You Softcore run. Prefer the Vole sign until you have finished most of the path progression. Astral mask or astral belt are both useful, but neither is required. Prefer candles for your eurdora. Workshed will be set to `model train set` by default at the start of the run, but this can be changed with the `workshed` argument.
3. Run `loopgyou` and watch it go! If you are more hesitant, you can run `loopgyou actions 10` to only do 10 things and stop.

Options can be changed in a few different ways:

- In the Mafia relay browser, select `loopgyou` from the dropdown in the top right. Be sure to `Save Changes` after modifying a setting.
- By setting a mafia setting, e.g. `set loopgyou_pulls=18` or `set loopgyou_delaytower=true`.
- By providing an argument at runtime, e.g. `loopgyou pulls=18 delaytower`. Note that any arguments provided at runtime override relay and mafia settings.

Run `loopgyou help` for the full set of script commands and options:

```
> loopgyou help

This is a script to complete Grey You Softcore runs. Run "loopgyou sim" without quotes to check if this script will work for you.

You must ascend manually into a Grey You Softcore run before running the script. The cold medicine cabinet is required in your workshed. Prefer the Vole sign until you have finished most of the path progression. Astral mask or astral belt are both useful, but neither is required. Prefer candles for your eurdora.

The arguments accepted by the script are listed below. Note that you can combine multiple options; for example "loopgyou pulls=18 tune=blender" will save 2 pulls and switch moon sign to Blender during the run. Most options also have an associated setting to set an option permanently; for example "set loopgyou_pulls=18" will cause the script to always save 2 pulls (unless overriden by using the pulls option at runtime).

Commands:
  sim - Check if you have the requirements to run this script.
  version - Show script version and exit.
  class NUMBER - If given, break the prism and choose a class. You will be reduced to 40 adventures with full organs after breaking the prism.

    class 3 - Pastamancer
    class 4 - Saurceror
    class 5 - Disco Bandit
    class 6 - Accordion Thief
  help - Show this message and exit.

Major Options:
  pulls NUMBER - Number of pulls to use. Lower this if you would like to save some pulls to use for in-ronin farming. (Note that this argument is not needed if you pull all your farming items before running the script). [default: 20] [setting: loopgyou_pulls]
  tune TEXT - Use your hewn moon-rune spoon to retune to this sign when optimal. [setting: loopgyou_tune]
  delaytower - Delay the NS tower until after ronin ends. [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_delaytower]
  delaywar - Delay the war until after ronin ends, then finish with stuffing fluffers. [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_delaywar]
  chargegoose NUMBER - If true, use extra familiar turns to charge your Grey Goose to this weight at the end of the run (for aftercore leveling). If you do not have enough extra familiar turns, the goose may be lower level. [default: 20] [setting: loopgyou_chargegoose]
  workshed ITEM - Workshed item to place in an empty workshed at the start of the run. [default: model train set] [setting: loopgyou_workshed]
    workshed none - Do nothing
    workshed model train set - Swap to model train set
    workshed cold medicine cabinet - Swap to cold medicine cabinet
    workshed Asdon Martin keyfob - Swap to asdon martin keyfob

  lgr - Pull a lucky gold ring. If pulled, it will be equipped during many combats. [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_lgr]
  jellies - Use your Space Jellyfish to get stench jellies during the war (this may reduce your goose familiar exp). [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_jellies]
  pvp - Break your hippy stone at the start of the run. [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_pvp]
  wand - Always get the zap wand. [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_wand]

  forcelocket - Always equip the combat lover's locket, in order to get monsters inside quickly. [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_forcelocket]
  savelocket NUMBER - Number of uses of the combat lover's locket to save. [default: 0] [setting: loopgyou_savelocket]
  luck NUMBER - Multiply the threshold for stopping execution when "you may just be unlucky". Increasing this can be dangerous and cause the script to waste more adventures; use at your own risk. [default: 1] [setting: loopgyou_luck]

Debug Options:
  actions NUMBER - Maximum number of actions to perform, if given. Can be used to execute just a few steps at a time. [setting: loopgyou_actions]
  verboseequip - Print out equipment usage before each task. [setting: loopgyou_verboseequip]

  ignorekeys - Ignore the check that all keys can be obtained. Typically for hardcore, if you plan to get your own keys [default: false] [setting: loopgyou_ignorekeys]
